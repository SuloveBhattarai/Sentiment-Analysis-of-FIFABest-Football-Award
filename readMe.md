## Sentiment Analysis of FIFABest Football Awards
I have done a NLP project where I have used Emotional and Sentiment dataset downloaded from Kaggle. 
At first, I have tested those data on different algorithms and found that Logistic Regression(TF-IDF) was the giving the best accuracy.
So, I utilized nitscrapper to extract data from the Twitter and scrapped 1000 Tweets.
Utilizing the best algorithms that I achived in the previous dataset, I used it to predict the sentiment of the tweets regarding FIFABest Award Ceremony.
Hence, you can see the output and visualization that depicts the sentiments of the tweets. 
Atlast, you can send automated email to the other users regarding the report of emotional and sentiment analysis.
